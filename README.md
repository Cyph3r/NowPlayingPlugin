### Unofficial Releases

A part of this repo will be releasing unofficial versions of the plugin. These versions will include any bugfixes or features that are not in the official version on the author's website.

### Official Releases

I will also attempt to keep up with the current official releases of this plugin and release those in the releases tab as well. This may or may not happen because I will need to manually update this repo to reflect the author's updates.

### Community Involvement
